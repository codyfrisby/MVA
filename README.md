# MVA: An Introduction to Applied Multivariate Analysis with R

Functions, data sets, analyses and examples from the book ‘An Introduction to Applied Multivariate Analysis with R’ (Brian S. Everitt and Torsten Hothorn, Springer, 2011).

## Install the current release from CRAN:
```r
install.packages('MVA')
```

## Install my development version from GitHub:
```r
devtools::install_github('codyfrisby/MVA')
```
## NOTE:  This was forked from CRAN/MVA.  It will not be updated to CRAN.  I started editing this package as part of my multivariate statistics coursework.  Originally I just wanted to add labels to points that were outside the outer ellipse on the `bvbox` function.
